MorkReader: A C# implementation of a Mork Parser
---

This project is the conversion from Java to C# of this source code: https://github.com/ibauersachs/jmork

MorkReader is starting to work... but it's not finished yet!

There is also a concise Python version here: https://github.com/ibauersachs/jmork/blob/master/doc/demork.py

The current Thunderbird source code is in C++, the Github mirror copy is here: https://github.com/mozilla/releases-comm-central/tree/master/mailnews/db/mork  
and the main source is here:  
https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/comm-central/file/tip/mailnews/db/mork
